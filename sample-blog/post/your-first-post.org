Grom detect a subset of org-mode syntax.

** This is a subheading
 
This is a numbered list: 
1. Item
2. Item
3. Item

This is a bullet list:
+ item
+ item
+ item  

You can post images from the img/ directory using: 

[[../img/emacs.jpg]] 

And grom fixes the size to the template and creates a link to the real size
image. You can [[http://golang.org][link an external resources]], too. By now, *you only can use jpeg
files*, but /next versions of grom/ let add any image format to your blog. You
_can contact me to report_ any bug or suggestion.
