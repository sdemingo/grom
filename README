*) What is Grom?

Grom is small static web content generator based on org-mode
syntax. The Org-mode is a major mode for Emacs created by Carsten
Dominik. Grom only support a subset of org-mode syntax. With Grom you
can create all contents for your website or your blog with this syntax
and Grom export it to HTML and build the site. You can get a short
review about org-mode syntax at http://orgmode.org/orgguide.pdf

Grom is written in Go and if you want build the binary you need to
have the Go environment. You can download it from http://golang.org


*) Quick start

You can create your first blog site with Grom building the sample site
which is included in the distribution. 

      $ grom build-blog sample-blog

Now, open sample/index.html in your favourite browse. You can edit the
org files in post/ directory or static/ directory. In the img/
directory you must put all images that you want to show in your posts
and pages. Don't worry about the images size, just link it. Grom
resize all of them and make the thumbs files.




*) Create a new site

You can create a new site writting the next command.

    grom create-blog <grom-dir> <site-dir>

Where <grom-dir> is the directory where grom was installed and
<site-dir> is the directory of the new blog.

Now you can add a new post or a new static page using: 
    
    grom add-post <site-dir> <post-name>	   
    grom add-static <site-dir> <static-page-name>	

To edit your new files you have open your text editor and load your
file from <site-dir>/posts or <site-dir>/static.

Finally, to build all the blog just type:

    grom build-blog <site-dir>
